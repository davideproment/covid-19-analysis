# COVID-19 Analysis

## England macro-area estimated deaths

**Disclaimer**: the predictions (solid lines and ribbons in the figures) are estimated using Gompertz functions, a very crude fitting exercise, they are not obtained using a model for spread of disease.

Figures and statistical forecast provided by Paolo Davini via his [COvId NineTeen R-based ElementAr Utility (Cointreau)](https://github.com/oloapinivad/Cointreau) project, used to forecast [Italian regions and other countries](http://wilma.to.isac.cnr.it/diss/paolo/covid-19/).

**Note** (from NHS England dataset): interpretation of the figures should take into account the fact that totals by date of death, particularly for recent prior days, are likely to be updated in future releases. For example as deaths are confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, as more post-mortem tests are processed and data from them are validated. Any changes are made clear in the daily files.
